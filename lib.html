			<p align="justify" style=""><b>Central Workshop:</b> In the present age when science and technology form the backbone of industry, a technocrat is expected to acquire greater level of skills and knowledge. He has to confront the complexities of competitive manufacture and very fast development in the design of machinery and innovations in productive methods. Engineering curriculum should therefore conform to the above need effectively. The main purpose of an engineering workshop is to provide the basic working knowledge of the production and properties of different material used in industry and to appraise the students of basics and applications of various types of tool, equipments, machinery and techniques used in manufacturing to facilitate shaping of these materials into useful products and components. The workshop caters both to students training at various level as well as production jobs specifically to meet needs of research, development, fabrication and maintenance for various departments and units of the Institute. About 300 graduate students are trained every semester through the course of Manufacturing Practice Workshop Training and Manufacturing Processes by imparting skills in various fabrication processes like fitting, machining, carpentry, electrical, welding, smithy, sheet metal etc. All students admitted to the first year go through this training process. Work Instructions to include step-by-step procedure for manufacturing jobs in each shop by the students as per course curriculum have been prepared for degree as classes. These are displayed at each machine during manufacturing of jobs.</p>
			<p><b>General objectives of workshop are:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>To acquire related trade knowledge and practical skills in metal cutting, metal joining, metal forming and other operations.</li>
				<li>To acquire related trade knowledge and practical skills in engineering measurements.</li>
				<li>Finishing various jobs within the specified limits, with proper measurements and valuating them by appropriate inspection methods and tools</li>
				<li>To acquire experience in preventive and corrective maintenance of various machine tools, cutting tools and equipments.</li>
			</ul>
		   <p align="justify">The aim in the workshop is to impart practical knowledge to the students and to produce a spirit of doing work with own hands. Students are also given small projects during summer training. College workshop also provides aid to the maintenance unit of the college. The workshop is having different shops viz.</p><br>
