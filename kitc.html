	 				<p>When you plan your kitchen, our supervisor or designer will first undertake a site visit to get all the detailed measurements of your kitchen. This will also help them understand your requirements.</p>
	 				<p> If you need any extra storage space, appliances and so on, remember to inform the designer at this stage itself. This is so that your kitchen can be planned and designed in a systematic way.</p>
	 				<p>Once the cost and design of your kitchen is finalized, we will give you all the electrical, tiling and plumbing details according to the final layout.</p>
	 				<p> After all the civic work is done, our team will take the final measurements of your kitchen and will also inform you if there are any changes in design due to civil changes at the site.</p>
	 				<p>Then, we will place the order and have it delivered within the required time frame, with the finish and material selected by you.</p>
	 				<p>After installing your kitchen, our service department will also provide you with a warranty card so that you can contact us easily for any service issues.</p>
